\begin{project}
  \title{SemEval2020 Task5 Modelling Casual Reasoning in Language: Detecting Counterfactuals }
  \supervisor{Supervisor : Dr.Xiaodan Zhu}
  \duration{Sep '19 - Jan '20}
  \description{
	- Constructed the dataset with more than 10,000 text instances. Collected the original data from Internet and removed all non-linguistic information from original data.\\
	- Revised the annotations made by annotators, split the whole dataset into training dataset and test dataset respectively.\\
	- Built a binary classification model as baseline model in subtask 1 using SVM. \\
	- Built a sequence labelling model as baseline model in subtask 2 using CRF. \\
	- Devised a word-level Precision/Recall/F1-score metric and a sentence-level Exact Match metric. Compared with existed metric functions provided by Pytorch, these two metrics could better measure models' performance in subtask 2. \\
	- For more details about this project, please refer to \href{http://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21691}{SemEval 2020 Task5}.} 
\end{project}
\begin{project}
  \title{Verbal Irony Detection}
  \supervisor{Supervisor : Dr.Xiaodan Zhu}
  \duration{Apr '20 - Now}
  \description{
	- Constructed the dataset which includes more than 1,500 text-audio bi-modality instances.\\
	- Built the audio-modality model based on Transformer, extracted the audio feature using OpenSmile and IS09 feature dataset. This model was a baseline model for audio-modality in this dataset.\\
	- Built the text-modality model based on BERT, This model was a baseline model for text-modality in this dataset.\\
	- Built two multi-modality fusion model as baseline models for multi-modality fusion in this dataset.
	- Devised a bi-linear fusion model based on cartesian product, compared with original fusion model, this model improved 6\% performance in this dataset.\\
	- We plan release our dataset, code on Github and submit our paper to Language Resource and Evaluation this December.\\

\section{Extra Interests}
\cusemph{Caligraphy}: Chinese Caligraphy uses writing brush made by weasel's or sheep's hair to write Chinese characters in different forms such as Song, Cao, Xing. It is a traditional art form in China. I practiced caligraphy for 6 years since I was ten year's old. \\
\cusemph{Computer Hardware}: Very interested in computer hardware, assembled a personal computer at very young age independently, helped many classmates choose hardwares (graphic card, cpu, memory, motherboard etc.) and assemble their own computers.
